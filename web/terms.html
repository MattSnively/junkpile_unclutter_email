    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Review each email carefully</strong> before making a keep/unsubscribe decision</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Unsubscribe Functionality and Limitations</h2>
    <h3>7.1 How Unsubscribing Works</h3>
    <p>When you swipe left on an email, Junkpile sends an unsubscribe request using the List-Unsubscribe header or link provided by the email sender. The email sender is responsible for honoring the unsubscribe request.</p>

    <div class="important">
        <h3>7.2 No Guarantee of Effectiveness</h3>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> We do NOT guarantee that all senders will honor unsubscribe requests or that unsubscribes will be processed immediately.</p>
        <p>Some senders may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delay processing (up to 10 business days is common)</li>
            <li>Continue sending "transactional" emails (order confirmations, account updates)</li>
            <li>Ignore unsubscribe requests entirely</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>You acknowledge that Junkpile has no control over whether senders honor unsubscribe requests.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="important">
        <h3>7.3 Irreversibility</h3>
        <p><strong>Unsubscribe actions are irreversible through Junkpile.</strong> If you wish to re-subscribe to a sender you unsubscribed from, you must contact that sender directly or re-subscribe through their website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="important">
        <h3>7.4 User Responsibility for Decisions</h3>
        <p><strong>You are solely responsible for your unsubscribe decisions.</strong> Junkpile executes your expressed intent but does not make decisions for you. We are NOT liable if you unsubscribe from emails you later wish you had kept (e.g., account notifications, newsletters you value).</p>
    </div>

    <h2>8. Gamification and Virtual Items</h2>
    <h3>8.1 XP, Levels, Achievements, and Streaks</h3>
    <p>Junkpile includes gamification features: XP, levels, achievements, and streaks.</p>

    <h3>8.2 No Monetary Value</h3>
    <p>These gamification elements have <strong>no monetary value</strong> and cannot be exchanged for cash or prizes.</p>

    <h3>8.3 Modification or Removal</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, remove, or reset gamification features at any time.</p>

    <h2>9. Premium Features and Subscriptions (Future)</h2>
    <h3>9.1 Future Paid Features</h3>
    <p>Junkpile may introduce premium features ("Junkpile Pro") in the future, which may include multiple email account support, advanced categorization, and exclusive achievements.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>9.3 Free Features Commitment</h3>
        <p><strong>The core swipe-to-unsubscribe functionality will always remain free.</strong> We will never paywall the basic unsubscribe feature.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Junkpile and all its contents are owned by us and protected by intellectual property laws. We grant you a limited license to use the App on your personal iOS device for non-commercial purposes.</p>

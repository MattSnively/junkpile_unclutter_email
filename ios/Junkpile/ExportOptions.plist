  ExportOptions.plist
  Used by `xcodebuild -exportArchive` to produce a signed IPA for App Store / TestFlight.

  - method: "app-store" targets App Store Connect (TestFlight + App Store).
  - signingStyle: "manual" because we supply the certificate and profile explicitly in CI.
  - teamID: Must match the Apple Developer Team ID (injected via CI secrets).
  - provisioningProfiles: Maps the bundle ID to the provisioning profile name created
    in the Apple Developer Portal.
  - uploadBitcode / uploadSymbols: Include symbols for crash reporting; bitcode is
    deprecated as of Xcode 14 but kept false explicitly for clarity.

# Terms of Service for Junkpile

**Last Updated: February 13, 2026**

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the Junkpile mobile application ("App," "Junkpile," or "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and Junkpile ("we," "us," or "our").

## 2. Description of Service

Junkpile is a mobile application that helps you manage email subscriptions by:
- Displaying email subscription messages from your Gmail account
- Allowing you to unsubscribe from unwanted email lists through a swipe interface
- Providing gamification features (XP, levels, achievements, streaks) to make email management engaging

**Junkpile is NOT:**
- An email client (we do not display full email content, compose emails, or replace your email app)
- A data analytics service (we do not analyze or sell your email data)
- A full inbox management tool (we focus exclusively on unsubscribing from mailing lists)

## 3. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use Junkpile. By using the App, you represent and warrant that:
- You are at least 13 years of age
- You have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms
- You have a valid email account (currently Gmail, with additional providers planned)

If you are under 18, you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian to use the App.

## 4. Account Creation and Security

### 4.1 Account Registration
To use Junkpile, you must:
- Sign in with Apple Sign-In OR Google Sign-In
- Connect your Gmail account via OAuth 2.0 authentication

### 4.2 Account Security
You are responsible for:
- Maintaining the security of your Apple ID or Google account
- All activities that occur under your Junkpile account
- Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use at support@junkpile.app

### 4.3 Account Termination
You may delete your Junkpile account at any time through Settings > Delete Account. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms.

## 5. Email Access and Permissions

### 5.1 Permissions Required
By connecting your Gmail account, you grant Junkpile permission to:
- **Read email metadata** (sender addresses, subject lines, List-Unsubscribe headers)
- **Send unsubscribe requests** on your behalf when you swipe left on an email
- **Access subscription-related emails** to display them in the swipe interface

### 5.2 What We DO NOT Access
Junkpile does NOT:
- Read the full content/body of your emails
- Delete emails from your inbox
- Send emails on your behalf (except unsubscribe requests)
- Access attachments, contacts, or other Google services

### 5.3 Revoking Access
You can revoke Junkpile's access to your Gmail account at any time through your Google Account settings (https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## 6. User Responsibilities and Prohibited Conduct

### 6.1 Your Responsibilities
You agree to:
- **Review each email carefully** before making a keep/unsubscribe decision
- **Accept that unsubscribe actions are irreversible** through the app
- **Use the App only for personal, non-commercial purposes**
- **Comply with all applicable laws** when using the Service

### 6.2 Prohibited Activities
You may NOT:
- Use the App to harass, abuse, or harm others
- Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App
- Use automated scripts, bots, or tools to interact with the App
- Violate any third-party rights (including email senders' rights)
- Use the App in any way that could damage, disable, or impair the Service
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our servers or systems

## 7. Unsubscribe Functionality and Limitations

### 7.1 How Unsubscribing Works
When you swipe left on an email:
- Junkpile sends an unsubscribe request using the List-Unsubscribe header or link provided by the email sender
- The request is sent immediately (or after a 5-second undo timer, if implemented)
- The email sender is responsible for honoring the unsubscribe request

### 7.2 No Guarantee of Effectiveness
**IMPORTANT:** We do NOT guarantee that:
- All senders will honor unsubscribe requests
- Unsubscribes will be processed immediately
- You will stop receiving emails from unsubscribed senders

Some senders may:
- Delay processing (up to 10 business days is common)
- Continue sending "transactional" emails (order confirmations, account updates)
- Ignore unsubscribe requests entirely (in violation of laws like CAN-SPAM)

**You acknowledge that Junkpile has no control over whether senders honor unsubscribe requests.**

### 7.3 Irreversibility
**Unsubscribe actions are irreversible through Junkpile.** If you wish to re-subscribe to a sender you unsubscribed from, you must contact that sender directly or re-subscribe through their website.

### 7.4 User Responsibility for Decisions
**You are solely responsible for your unsubscribe decisions.** Junkpile executes your expressed intent but does not make decisions for you. We are NOT liable if you unsubscribe from emails you later wish you had kept (e.g., account notifications, newsletters you value).

## 8. Gamification and Virtual Items

### 8.1 XP, Levels, Achievements, and Streaks
Junkpile includes gamification features:
- **XP (experience points)** earned by processing emails
- **Levels** unlocked by accumulating XP
- **Achievements** unlocked by completing specific milestones
- **Streaks** maintained by using the app daily

### 8.2 No Monetary Value
These gamification elements have **no monetary value** and cannot be exchanged for cash or prizes. They exist solely to enhance your experience within the App.

### 8.3 Modification or Removal
We reserve the right to modify, remove, or reset gamification features at any time, including:
- Adjusting XP values or level requirements
- Adding, removing, or modifying achievements
- Resetting streaks or statistics (e.g., due to bugs or abuse)

- Subscriptions auto-renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period
- Refunds are subject to Apple's refund policy
